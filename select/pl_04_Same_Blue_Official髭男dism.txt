Is it over?
But I never wanna surrender
I'm sober, yet so sad
You are my only return address
I'm nothing without you
That distance still feels so long
It's like a never-ending car chase
My blood ran faster
And I kicked the ground so hard
At last, do I have to lose you?
Is this my punishment or curse?
The sky and sea are just the same blue
意地を張って
見つめる鏡の中
気付かないんだきっと
静かなあの夜も
違うページ開いてる
違うビート刻んでる
I can't be the same blue
At last, do I have to lose you?
Is this my punishment or curse?
The sky and sea are just the same blue
まだ　追いつけないって
響く　届かないこの鼓動に乗せ
君と僕は　the same blue
陽が消えるその時まで
